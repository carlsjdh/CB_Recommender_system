Blackberry and raspberry aromas show a typical Navarran whiff of green herbs and, in this case,
horseradish. In the mouth, this is fairly full bodied, with tomatoey acidity. Spicy,
herbal flavors complement dark plum fruit, while the finish is fresh but grabby.
This dry and restrained wine offers spice in profusion. Balanced with acidity and a firm texture, it's very much for food.
